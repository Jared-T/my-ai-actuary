Are variable/function names descriptive?\n- **Maintainability**: Will this code be easy to modify in the future?\n- **DRY Principle**: Is there any duplicated code that should be abstracted?\n- **Single Responsibility**: Do functions and classes have a single, clear purpose?\n\n### Best Practices\n- Follow established patterns and conventions used in the codebase\n- Ensure proper error handling is in place\n- Check for appropriate logging where needed\n- Verify that magic numbers/strings are replaced with named constants\n\n### Performance\n- Identify any potential performance bottlenecks\n- Check for unnecessary re-renders (React) or redundant computations\n- Ensure efficient data structures are used\n\n### Testing\n- Verify that new code has appropriate test coverage\n- Check that edge cases are handled\n\n### Action Required\nAfter reviewing, make any necessary improvements directly. If you find issues:\n1. Fix them immediately if they are straightforward\n2. For complex issues, document them clearly with suggested solutions\n\nProvide a brief summary of changes made or issues found.",
